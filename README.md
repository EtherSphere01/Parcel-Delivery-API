# Parcel Delivery API

A secure, modular, and role-based backend API for a parcel delivery system, built with **Express.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Mongoose**. This system enables users to register, create parcel delivery requests, and track their status through a complete lifecycle, with administrative controls for user management, parcel oversight, and promotional campaigns.

### Postman APIs collection: https://github.com/EtherSphere01/Parcel-Delivery-API/blob/main/Parcel%20Delivery%20API.postman_collection.json

## ‚ú® Features

-   **JWT Authentication**: Secure, stateless authentication using JSON Web Tokens with access and refresh token rotation.
-   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Three distinct user roles (`ADMIN`, `SENDER`, `RECEIVER`) with granular permissions for every action.
-   **Complete Parcel Lifecycle**: Full management of parcels from creation to delivery, with a detailed, embedded status log.
-   **Dynamic Fee Calculation**: Delivery fees are calculated based on parcel weight.
-   **Coupon & Discount System**: Admins can create, manage, and delete promotional coupon codes that apply percentage-based discounts to delivery fees.
-   **Admin Dashboard Analytics**: A dedicated endpoint for admins to fetch key statistics like total users, parcels, revenue, and status breakdowns.
-   **Relational Data Integrity**: Ensures parcels can only be sent to valid, registered users with the `RECEIVER` role.
-   **Modular Architecture**: Organized by feature into distinct modules (`auth`, `user`, `parcel`, `coupon`, `admin`) for maintainability and scalability.
-   **Robust Validation**: Uses **Zod** for type-safe validation of all incoming requests to prevent bad data.
-   **Global Error Handling**: Centralized middleware for consistent and predictable API responses.

# Database URL

DB_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/parcel-delivery

# Bcrypt Salt Rounds

BCRYPT_SALT_ROUNDS=10

# JWT Secrets and Expiration

JWT_ACCESS_SECRET=your-super-secret-for-access-token
JWT_ACCESS_EXPIRES=1d

Replace the placeholders (e.g., `your-super-secret-for-access-token`) with secure values. Ensure the `DB_URL` points to your MongoDB instance.

### 4. Running the Application

#### For Development (with auto-reloading):

```bash
npm run dev
```

#### For Production:

1. Build the TypeScript code into JavaScript:

```bash
npm run build
```

2. Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

The server will be running at `http://localhost:5000`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Functionality

### User Roles

The system supports three distinct user roles with specific permissions:

-   **SENDER**: Can create parcel delivery requests, view their own parcels, and cancel parcels in `REQUESTED` or `APPROVED` states.
-   **RECEIVER**: Can view all parcels addressed to them.
-   **ADMIN**: Has full control, including managing users, parcels, coupons, and accessing dashboard analytics.

### Parcel Lifecycle & Status

Each parcel follows a defined lifecycle, tracked by its status, which is updated by admins:

-   **REQUESTED**: A sender creates a parcel, pending admin approval.
-   **APPROVED**: An admin approves the request, and the parcel is ready for pickup.
-   **DISPATCHED**: The parcel is picked up and en route to the hub.
-   **IN_TRANSIT**: The parcel is between hubs or out for final delivery.
-   **DELIVERED**: The receiver has received the parcel.
-   **CANCELLED**: The sender or admin cancels the parcel (only possible in `REQUESTED` states).

### Fee Calculation & Coupon Usage

-   **Fee Calculation**: The delivery fee is calculated as `Base Fee (50 BDT) + (Weight in kg * 10 BDT)`.
-   **Coupon Application**: Senders can apply an optional `couponCode` during parcel creation. If the code is valid, active, and not expired, a percentage-based discount is applied to the delivery fee.

### Relational Data Integrity

-   Parcels can only be addressed to registered users with the `RECEIVER` role, ensuring data consistency.
-   Mongoose enforces relational constraints through schema validation.

## üìù Notes

-   Ensure MongoDB is running locally or use a cloud-based MongoDB instance (e.g., MongoDB Atlas) for the `DB_URL`.
-   Use strong, unique secrets for `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET` and `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` to ensure security.
-   The admin seed credentials (`ADMIN_EMAIL`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `ADMIN_PHONE`) are used to create an initial admin user during setup.
